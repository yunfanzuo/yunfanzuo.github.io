          <h2 id="1-A-private-conversation"><a href="#1-A-private-conversation" class="headerlink" title="1 A private conversation"></a>1 A private conversation</h2><p>Last week I went to the theater.  I had a very good seat.  The play was very interesting.  I did not enjoy it.  A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me.  They were talking loudly.  I got very angry.  I could not hear the actors.  I turned round.  I looked at the man and the woman angrily.  They did not pay any attention.  In the end,  I could not bear it.  I turned round again.  “I can’ t hear a word!” I said angrily.  “It’s none of your business,” the young man said rudely.  “This is a private conversation!”</p>
<h2 id="2-Breakfast-or-Lunch"><a href="#2-Breakfast-or-Lunch" class="headerlink" title="2 Breakfast or Lunch"></a>2 Breakfast or Lunch</h2><p>It was Sunday.  I never get up early on Sundays.  I sometimes stay in bed until lunchtime.  Last Sunday I got up very late.  I looked out of the window.  It was dark outside.  “What a day!” I thought.  “It’s raining again.”  Just then, the telephone rang.  It was my aunt Lucy.  “I’ve just arrived by train,” she said.  “I’m coming to see you.”  “But I’m still having breakfast,” I said.  “What are you doing?” she asked. “I’m having breakfast,” I repeated.  “Dear me!” she said. “Do you always get up so late? It’s one o’clock!”</p>
<h2 id="3-Please-send-me-a-card"><a href="#3-Please-send-me-a-card" class="headerlink" title="3 Please send me a card"></a>3 Please send me a card</h2><p>Postcards always spoil my holidays.  Last summer, I went to Italy.  I visited museums and sat in public gardens.  A friendly waiter taught me a few words of Italian.  Then he lent me a book.  I read a few lines, but I did not understand a word.  Everyday I thought about postcards.  My holidays passed quickly, but I did not send cards to my friends.  On the last day I made a big decision.  I got up early and bought thirty-seven cards.  I spent the whole day in my room, but I did not write a single card!</p>
<h2 id="4-An-exciting-trip"><a href="#4-An-exciting-trip" class="headerlink" title="4 An exciting trip"></a>4 An exciting trip</h2><p>I have just received a letter from my brother, Tim.  He is in Australia.  He has been there for six months.  Tim is an engineer.  He is working for a big firm and he has already visited a great number of different places in Australia.  He has just bought an Australian car and has gone to Alice Springs, a small town in the center of Australia.  He will soon visit Darwin.  From there, he will fly to Perth.  My brother has never been abroad before, so he is finding this trip very exciting.</p>
<h2 id="5-No-wrong-numbers"><a href="#5-No-wrong-numbers" class="headerlink" title="5 No wrong numbers"></a>5 No wrong numbers</h2><p>Mr. James Scott has a garage in Silbury and now he has just bought another garage in Pinhurst.  Pinhust is only five miles from Silbury, but Mr. Scott cannot get a telephone for his new garage, so he has just bought twelve pigeons.  Yesterday, a pigeon carried the first message from Pinhurst to Silbury.  The bird covered the distance in three minutes.  Up to now, Mr. Scott has sent a great many requests for spare parts and other urgent messages from one garage to the other.  In this way, he has begun his own private “telephone” service.</p>
<h2 id="6-Percy-Buttons"><a href="#6-Percy-Buttons" class="headerlink" title="6 Percy Buttons"></a>6 Percy Buttons</h2><p>I have just moved to a house in Bridge Street.  Yesterday a beggar knocked at my door.  He asked me for a meal and a glass of beer.  In return for this, the beggar stood on his head and sang songs.  I gave him a meal.  He ate the food and drank the beer.  Then he put a piece of cheese in his pocket and went away.  Later a neighbor told me about him.  Everybody knows him.  His name is Percy Buttons.  He calls at every house in the street once a month and always asks for a meal and a glass of beer.</p>
<h2 id="7-Too-late"><a href="#7-Too-late" class="headerlink" title="7 Too late"></a>7 Too late</h2><p>The plane was late and the detectives were waiting at the airport all morning.  They were expecting a valuable parcel of diamonds from South Africa.  A few hours earlier, someone has told the police that thieves would try to steal the diamonds.  When the plane arrived, some of the detectives were waiting inside the main building while others were waiting on the airfield.  Two men toke the parcel off the plane and carried it into the Customs House.  While two detectives were keeping guard at the door, two others opened the parcel.  To their surprise, the precious parcel was full of stones and sand!</p>
<h2 id="8-The-best-and-the-worst"><a href="#8-The-best-and-the-worst" class="headerlink" title="8 The best and the worst"></a>8 The best and the worst</h2><p>Joe Sanders has the most beautiful garden in our town.  Nearly everybody enters for “The Nicest Garden Competition” each year, but Joe wins every time.  Bill Frith’s garden is larger than Joe’s.  Bill works harder than Joe and grows more flowers and vegetables, but Joe’s garden is more interesting.  He has made neat paths and has built a wooden bridge over a pool.  I like gardens too, but I do not like hard work.  Every year I enter for the garden competition too, and I always win a little prize for the worst garden in the town.</p>
<h2 id="9-A-cold-welcome"><a href="#9-A-cold-welcome" class="headerlink" title="9 A cold welcome"></a>9 A cold welcome</h2><p>On Wednesday evening, we went to the Town Hall.  It was the last day of the year and a large crowd of people had gathered under the Town Hall clock.  It would strike twelve in twenty minutes time.  Fifteen minutes passed and then,  at five to twelve,  the clock stopped.  The big minute hand did not move.  We waited and waited, but nothing happened.  Suddenly someone shouted, “It’s two minutes passed twelve! the clock is stopped!”  I looked at my watch.  It was true.  The big clock refused to welcome the New Year.  At that moment, everybody began to laugh and sing.</p>
<h2 id="10-Not-for-jazz"><a href="#10-Not-for-jazz" class="headerlink" title="10 Not for jazz"></a>10 Not for jazz</h2><p>We have an old musical instrument.  It is called a clavichord.  It was made in Germany in 1681.  Our clavichord is kept in the living room.  It was belonged to our family for a long time.  The instrument was bought by my grandfather many years ago.  Recently it was damaged by a visitor.  She tried to play jazz on it.  She struck the keys too hard and two of the strings were broken.  My father was shocked.  Now we are not allowed to touch it.  It is being repaired by a friend of my father’s.</p>
